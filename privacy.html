    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hagerlabs, LLC (“Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy.</p>
    <p>We recognize that your privacy is important, and we intentionally limit the information we collect to the minimum necessary to provide and improve our services.</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you use our websites (the “Site”), mobile application(s) (the “App”), and related products and services (collectively, the “Platform”). It also explains our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information.</p>
    <ul>

      <li>What Information We Collect About You</li>
      <li>How We Collect Information</li>
      <li>Partners and Third Parties That May Collect Information</li>
      <li>Collection within the United States</li>
      <li>How We Use the Information We Collect</li>
      <li>How We Share the Information We Collect</li>
      <li>How We Retain and Protect Your Information</li>
      <li>Third-Party Sites and Apps</li>
      <li>Accessing and Correcting Your Information</li>
      <li>Your Data Rights</li>
      <li>Use of Cookies</li>
      <li>Changes to This Policy</li>
      <li>Contact Us</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If changes occur, we will revise the “Last Revised” date above and, in some cases, provide additional notice through the App or Site.</p>
    <p><strong>By using or accessing Mixport, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</strong></p>
    <p>If you do not agree with this Policy, please do not use the Platform.</p>
    <p>If you have questions about this Policy or our data practices, please contact us at <a href="mailto:wes@hagerlabs.com">support@hagerlabs.com</a>.</p>
    <h2>Age Restrictions</h2>
    <p>The Platform is not intended for persons under the age of 13 or for anyone who cannot legally enter into a binding contract without parental consent. By creating an account or using the Platform, you confirm that you are not under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:wes@hagerlabs.com">support@hagerlabs.com</a>, and we will delete it promptly.</p>
    <h2>What Information We Collect About You</h2>
    <p>When using Mixport, we may collect limited and anonymized data about your actions within the Platform—such as playlist transfer events, subscription validation, and account activity—to improve performance and functionality.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Subscription verification:</strong> We may process purchase receipts solely to confirm the validity of your subscription or in-app purchase.</li>
      <li><strong>Music service authentication:</strong> When connecting a supported music service (e.g., Spotify, Apple Music), your credentials are exchanged for access tokens. When token-based authentication is unavailable, credentials are securely stored on your device using iOS/macOS Keychain.</li>
      <li><strong>Library access:</strong> To perform transfers, we read metadata from your connected music accounts. We do not permanently store your music library or account data on our servers beyond what is temporarily required for processing and matching.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How We Collect Information</h2>
    <p>We use an in-house analytics system designed to respect user privacy. We do <strong>not</strong> use third-party advertising SDKs or tracking networks. Our analytics collect only aggregated and non-identifying data to help us understand app performance and improve the user experience.</p>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> automatically collect personally identifiable information beyond what you voluntarily provide or what is necessary for authentication and subscription management.</p>
    <h2>Partners and Third Parties That May Collect Information</h2>
    <p>We use third-party services to manage subscriptions, payments, and related transactions. For example, we rely on <strong>RevenueCat, Inc.</strong> (“RevenueCat”) to manage in-app subscriptions and purchases. RevenueCat may collect and process limited user data necessary to verify purchases. Their privacy policy can be found at <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/">https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/</a>. In some cases, RevenueCat may share information (such as refund or purchase validation details) with platforms like Apple. Any information Hagerlabs receives from RevenueCat is handled in accordance with this Policy.</p>
    <h2>Collection within the United States</h2>
    <p>Hagerlabs, LLC is based in the United States. By using Mixport, you consent to the processing and storage of your data in the U.S. or other jurisdictions that may have different data protection laws than your own.</p>
    <p>If you access the Platform from outside the U.S., your information may be transferred internationally. We take reasonable steps to ensure adequate protection of your personal data wherever it is processed.</p>
    <h2>How We Use the Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Operate and improve Mixport and its features.</li>
      <li>Authenticate users and manage subscriptions.</li>
      <li>Provide technical support and respond to inquiries.</li>
      <li>Detect and prevent fraud, unauthorized activity, and misuse.</li>
      <li>Analyze aggregate usage patterns to guide product development.</li>
      <li>Comply with legal and contractual obligations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal information to any third parties.</p>
    <h2>How We Share the Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>With service providers such as Apple or RevenueCat to manage purchases and account status.</li>
      <li>To comply with applicable law, regulation, or legal request.</li>
      <li>To protect the rights, safety, and property of Hagerlabs, our users, or others.</li>
      <li>In connection with a merger, sale, or transfer of assets.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may share anonymized or aggregated information that does not identify any individual without restriction.</p>
    <h2>How We Retain and Protect Your Information</h2>
    <p>We retain data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined above or as required by law. All personal data is stored on secure servers and transmitted using encryption. Subscription and payment data are processed by trusted third parties using secure, industry-standard methods.</p>
    <p>Please remember to protect your password and device access credentials. No internet transmission is fully secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of your data.</p>
    <h2>Third-Party Sites and Apps</h2>
    <p>Mixport may contain links or integrations with external services such as Apple Music, Spotify, or YouTube. These services are governed by their own privacy policies. We are not responsible for the content or data practices of any external websites or applications.</p>
    <p>If Mixport uses YouTube API Services, your use is also subject to Google’s Privacy Policy and YouTube’s Terms of Service. You can revoke YouTube API access at: <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions">https://myaccount.google.com/permissions</a>.</p>
    <h2>Accessing and Correcting Your Information</h2>
    <p>You may review, update, or delete your account information at any time within the App. You can also contact <a href="mailto:wes@hagerlabs.com">support@hagerlabs.com</a> to request corrections or deletion of personal data, subject to legal retention obligations.</p>
    <h2>Your Data Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on where you live, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data, including the rights to know, access, delete, correct, withdraw consent, and portability where applicable.</p>
